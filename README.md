When selecting `.sl` for Playlist, you will be greeted by a list of Playlists you
have entered in the appropriate node in the workflow. After installation, you should
take a little time to change this list to contain your favourite playlists.

## Controlling Volume

Type `.v` to activate the Volume controls.

Please be aware the `BLEEDING EARS` option was mostly added as a joke. It is REALLY
LOUD when you're wearing headphones. Please be careful with your ears and I will not
be responsible for any damages inflicted while using this workflow.
